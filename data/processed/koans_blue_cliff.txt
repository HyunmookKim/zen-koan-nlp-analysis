Chih said, "He is the Mahasattva Avalokitesvara, transmitting
the Buddha Mind Seal. "11 The Emperor felt regretful, so he
wanted to send an emissary to go invite (Bodhidharma to re­
turn).12 Master Chih told him, "Your majesty, don't say that
you will send someone to fetch him back.13 Even if everyone in
the whole country were to go after him, he still wouldn't re­
