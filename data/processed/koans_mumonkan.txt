A monk asked Chao-chou, “Has the dog Buddha nature or not?”
Chao-chou said, “Mu.”1

=== CASE 2 ===
Once when Pai-chang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening
together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. One day, however, he remained
behind. Pai-chang asked him, “Who are you, standing here before me?”
The old man replied, “I am not a human being. In the far distant past, in the time of
Kāśyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an
enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, 'Such a person does
not fall under the law of cause and effect.' With this I was reborn five hundred times as a fox.
Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox.”
He then asked Pai-chang, “Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and
effect or not?”
Pai-chang said, “Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect.”
Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened. Making his bows he said, “I am
released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a
request of you. Please, Abbot, perform my funeral as for a priest.”
Pai-chang had a head monk strike the signal board and inform the assembly that after the
noon meal there would be a funeral service for a priest. The monks talked about this in wonder.
“All of us are well. There is no one in the morgue. What does the teacher mean?”

Not falling into cause and effect can bring the wild fox to life;
not obscuring cause and effect kills him stone dead.
If you still don't understand
why don't you go to the foot of the north cliff and take a look at him.

After the meal, Pai-chang led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain.
And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then performed the ceremony
of cremation. That evening he took the high seat before his assembly and told the monks the
whole story.
Huang-po stepped forward and said, “As you say, the old man missed the turning word and
was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given the right answer each time he was
asked a question—what would have happened then?”
Pai-chang said, “Just step up here closer, and I'll tell you.” Huang-po went up to Pai-chang
and slapped him in the face.
Pai-chang clapped his hands and laughed, saying, “I thought the Barbarian had a red
beard, but here is a red-bearded Barbarian.”

=== CASE 3 ===
Whenever Chü-chih was asked a question, he simply raised one finger. One day a visitor asked
Chü-chih's attendant what his master preached. The boy raised a finger. Hearing of this, Chü-
chih cut off the boy's finger with a knife. As he ran from the room, screaming with pain, Chü-
chih called to him. When he turned his head, Chü-chih raised a finger. The boy was suddenly
enlightened.
When Chü-chih was about to die, he said to his assembled monks: “I received this one-
finger Zen from T'ien-lung. I used it all my life but never used it up.” With this he entered into
his eternal rest.

=== CASE 4 ===
Huo-an asked, “Why has the Western Barbarian no beard?”

=== CASE 5 ===
The priest Hsiang-yen said, “It is as though you were up in a tree, hanging from a branch with
your teeth. Your hands and feet can't touch any branch. Someone appears beneath the tree and
asks, 'What is the meaning of Bodhidharma's coming from the West?' If you do not answer, you
evade your responsibility. If you do answer, you lose your life. What do you do?”

=== CASE 6 ===
Once, in ancient times, when the World-Honored One was at Mount Grdhrakūta, he twirled a
flower before his assembled disciples. All were silent. Only Mahākāśyapa broke into a smile.
The World-Honored One said, “I have the eye treasury of right Dharma, the subtle mind of
nirvana, the true form of no-form, and the flawless gate of the teaching. It is not established
upon words and phrases. It is a special transmission outside tradition. I now entrust this to
Mahākāśyapa.”

=== CASE 7 ===
A monk said to Chao-chou, “I have just entered this monastery. Please teach me.”
Chao-chou said, “Have you eaten your rice gruel?”
The monk said, “Yes, I have.”
Chao-chou said, “Wash your bowl.” The monk understood.

=== CASE 8 ===
The priest Yüeh-an said to a monk, “Hsi-chung made a hundred carts. If you take off both

=== CASE 9 ===
A monk asked the priest Ch'ing-jang of Hsing-yang, “The Buddha of Supremely Pervading,
Surpassing Wisdom did zazen on the Bodhi Seat for ten kalpas, but the Dharma of the Buddha
did not manifest itself and he could not attain Buddhahood. Why was this?”
Ch'ing-jang said, “Your question is exactly to the point.”
The monk said, “But he did zazen on the Bodhi Seat; why couldn't he attain Buddhahood?”
Ch'ing-jang said, “Because he is a nonattained Buddha.”

=== CASE 10 ===
A monk said to Ts'ao-shan, “I am Ch'ing-shui, solitary and destitute. Please give me alms.”
Ts'ao-shan said, “Venerable Shui!”
Ch'ing-shui said, “Yes, sir!”
Ts'ao-shan said, “You have already drunk three cups of the finest wine in China, and still
you say that you have not moistened your lips.”

=== CASE 11 ===
Chao-chou went to a hermit's cottage and asked, “Anybody in? Anybody in?” The hermit lifted
up his fist.
Chao-chou said, “The water is too shallow for a ship to anchor.” And he left.
Again he went to a hermit's cottage and asked, “Anybody in? Anybody in?” This hermit too
lifted up his fist.
Chao-chou said, “Freely you give, freely you take away, freely you kill, freely you give life.”
And he made a full bow.

=== CASE 12 ===
The priest Jui-yen called “Master!” to himself every day and answered himself “Yes!”
Then he would say “Be aware!” and reply “Yes!”
“Don't be deceived by others!”
“No, no!”

Te-shan one day descended to the dining hall, bowls in hand. Hsüeh-feng asked him, “Where are
you going with your bowls in hand, Old Teacher? The bell has not rung, and the drum has not
sounded.” Te-shan turned and went back to his room.
Hsüeh-feng brought up this matter with Yen-t'ou. Yen-t'ou said, “Te-shan, great as he is,
does not yet know the last word.”
Hearing about this, Te-shan sent for Yen-t'ou and asked, “Don't you approve of this old
monk?” Yen-t'ou whispered his meaning. Te-shan said nothing further.
Next day, when Te-shan took the high seat before his assembly, his presentation was very
different from usual. Yen-t'ou came to the front of the hall, rubbing his hands and laughing
loudly, saying, “How delightful! Our Old Boss has got hold of the last word. From now on, no
one under heaven can outdo him!”

=== CASE 14 ===
The priest Nan-ch'üan found monks of the eastern and western halls arguing about a cat. He
held up the cat and said, “Everyone! If you can say something, I will spare this cat. If you can't
say anything, I will cut off its head.” No one could say a word, so Nan-ch'üan cut the cat into
two.
That evening, Chao-chou returned from outside and Nan-ch'üan told him what happened.
Chao-chou removed a sandal from his foot, put it on his head, and walked out.
Nan-ch'üan said, “If you had been there, the cat would have been spared.”

=== CASE 15 ===
Tung-shan came to see Yün-men. Yün-men asked him, “Where were you most recently?”
Tung-shan said, “At Ch'a-tu.”
Yün-men said, “Where were you during the summer?”
Tung-shan said, “At Pao-tzu Monastery in Hu-nan.”
Yün-men said, “When did you leave there?”
Tung-shan said, “August 25th.”
Yün-men said, “I spare you sixty blows.”
Next day, Tung-shan came again and said, “Yesterday you said you spared me sixty blows. I
don't know where I was at fault.”
Yün-men said, “You rice bag! Do you go about in such a way, now west of the river, now
south of the lake!”
With this, Tung-shan had great satori.

=== CASE 16 ===
Yün-men said, “See how vast and wide the world is! Why do you put on your seven-piece robe at
the sound of the bell?”

=== CASE 17 ===
Chung Kuo-shih called his attendant three times, and three times his attendant responded. Kuo-

A monk asked Tung-shan, “What is Buddha?”
Tung-shan said, “Three pounds of flax.”

=== CASE 19 ===
Chao-chou asked Nan-ch'üan, “What is the Tao?”
Nan-ch'üan said, “Ordinary mind is the Tao.”
Chao-chou asked, “Should I try to direct myself toward it?”
Nan-ch'üan said, “If you try to direct yourself you betray your own practice.”
Chao-chou asked, “How can I know the Tao if I don't direct myself?”
Nan-ch'üan said, “The Tao is not subject to knowing or not knowing. Knowing is delusion;
not knowing is blankness. If you truly reach the genuine Tao, you will find it as vast and
boundless as outer space. How can this be discussed at the level of affirmation and negation?”
With these words, Chao-chou had sudden realization.

=== CASE 20 ===
The priest Sung-yüan asked, “Why can't the person of great strength lift up a leg?”
Again he said, “It is not with the tongue that you speak.”

A monk asked Yün-men, “What is Buddha?”
Yün-men said, “Dried shitstick.”

Ānanda asked Mahākāśyapa, “The World-Honored One transmitted the robe of gold brocade to
you. What else did he transmit to you?”
Kāśyapa said, “Ānanda!”
Ānanda answered, “Yes!”
Kāśyapa said, “Knock down the flagpole at the gate.”

=== CASE 23 ===
The Sixth Ancestor was pursued by Ming the head monk as far as Ta-yü Peak. The teacher,
seeing Ming coming, laid the robe and bowl on a rock and said, “This robe represents the
Dharma. There should be no fighting over it. You may take it back with you.”
Ming tried to lift it up, but it was as immovable as a mountain. Shivering and trembling, he
said, “I came for the Dharma, not for the robe. I beg you, lay brother, please open the Way for
me.”
The teacher said, “Don't think good; don't think evil. At this very moment, what is the
original face of Ming the head monk?”
In that instant Ming had great satori. Sweat ran from his entire body. In tears he made his
bows saying, “Beside these secret words and secret meanings, is there anything of further
significance?”
The teacher said, “What I have just conveyed to you is not secret. If you reflect on your own
face, whatever is secret will be right there with you.”
Ming said, “Though I practiced at Huang-mei with the assembly, I could not truly realize
my original face. Now, thanks to your pointed instruction, I am like someone who drinks water
and knows personally whether it is cold or warm. Lay brother, you are now my teacher.”
The teacher said, “If you can say that, then let us both call Huang-mei our teacher.
Maintain your realization carefully.”

Paintings by proper artists follow laws;
Sengai's paintings follow none.

the no-law law is also the law.

=== CASE 24 ===
A monk asked the priest Feng-hsüeh, “Speech and silence are concerned with equality and
differentiation. How can I transcend equality and differentiation?”
Feng-hsüeh said,
I always think of Chiang-nan in March;
partridges chirp among the many fragrant flowers.

=== CASE 25 ===
Yang-shan dreamed he went to Maitreya's realm and was led to the third seat. A senior monk
struck the stand with a gavel and announced, “Today, the one in the third seat will preach.”
Yang-shan arose, struck the stand with the gavel, and said, “The truth of the Mahayana is
beyond the Four Propositions and transcends the Hundred Negations. Listen, listen.”

=== CASE 26 ===
The great Fa-yen of Ch'ing-liang took the high seat before the midday meal to preach to his
assembly. Raising his hand he pointed to the bamboo blinds. Two monks went and rolled them
up in the same manner. Fa-yen said, “One gains; one loses.”

=== CASE 27 ===
A monk asked Nan-ch'üan, “Is there a fundamental truth that has never been expounded for
people?”
Nan-ch'üan said, “There is.”
The monk said, “What is the fundamental truth that has never been expounded for people?”
Nan-ch'üan said, “It is not mind; it is not Buddha; it is not beings.”

=== CASE 28 ===
Te-shan visited Lung-t'an and questioned him sincerely far into the night. It grew late and
Lung-t'an said, “Why don't you retire?” Te-shan made his bows and lifted the blinds to
withdraw, but was met by darkness. Turning back he said, “It is dark outside.”
Lung-t'an lit a paper candle and handed it to Te-shan. Te-shan was about to take it when
Lung-t'an blew it out. At this, Te-shan had sudden realization and made bows.
Lung-t'an said, “What truth did you discern?”
Te-shan said, “From now on I will not doubt the words of an old priest who is renowned
everywhere under the sun.”
The next day Lung-t'an took the high seat before his assembly and said, “I see a brave
fellow among you monks. His fangs are like a sword-tree. His mouth is like a blood-bowl. Give
him a blow and he won't turn his head. Someday he will climb the highest peak and establish
our Way there.”
Te-shan brought his notes on the Diamond Sutra before the Dharma Hall and held up a torch,
saying, “Even though you have exhausted the abstruse doctrines, it is like placing a hair in vast
space. Even though you have learned all the secrets of the world, it is like letting a single drop
of water fall into an enormous valley.” And he burned up all his notes. Then, making his bows,
he took leave of his teacher.

Punctuate what mind?
Past? Present? Future?
The candle is blown out
and the Diamond is ashes.

=== CASE 29 ===
Two monks were arguing about the temple flag waving in the wind. One said, “The flag moves.”
The other said, “The wind moves.” They argued back and forth but could not agree.
The Sixth Ancestor said, “Gentlemen! It is not the wind that moves; it is not the flag that
moves; it is your mind that moves.” The two monks were struck with awe.

Ta-mei asked Ma-tsu, “What is Buddha?”
Ma-tsu said, “This very mind is Buddha.”

A monk asked an old woman, “What is the way to Mount T'ai?”
The old woman said, “Go straight ahead.”
When the monk had proceeded a few steps, she said, “A good respectable monk, but he too
goes off like that.”
When Chao-chou heard about this, he said, “Hold on! I'll go and investigate that old woman
thoroughly for you.”
Next day, Chao-chou went and asked her the same question, and she replied in the same
way. He returned and announced to his assembly, “I have investigated and seen through that
old woman of Mount T'ai for you.”

=== CASE 32 ===
An outsider asked the World-Honored One, “I do not ask for the spoken; I do not ask for the
unspoken.” The World-Honored One just sat still.
The outsider praised him, saying, “The World-Honored One with his great compassion and
mercy has opened the clouds of my delusion and enabled me to enter the Way.” He then made
bows and took his leave.
Ānanda asked, “What did that outsider realize to make him praise you?”
The World-Honored One said, “He is like the fine horse who runs even at the shadow of the
whip.”

=== CASE 33 ===
A monk asked Ma-tsu, “What is Buddha?”
Ma-tsu said, “Not mind, not Buddha.”

=== CASE 34 ===
Nan-ch'üan said, “Mind is not Buddha; wisdom is not the Tao.”

=== CASE 35 ===
Wu-tsu asked a monk, “The woman Ch'ien and her spirit separated. Which is the true Ch'ien?”

=== CASE 36 ===
of the separation of the spirit of the girl Ch'ien, which was the true Ch'ien?”' It was only because of this
question that the story was cited in the book. But the question is not answered. The author only remarks: 'If
you can decide which was the real Ch'ien, then you will have learned that to go out of one envelope and into
another is merely like putting up at an inn. But if you have not yet reached this degree of enlightenment,
take heed that you do not wander aimlessly about the world. Otherwise, when Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind
shall suddenly be dissipated, you will be like a crab with seven hands and eight legs, thrown into boiling
water. And in that time do not say that you were never told about the Thing.'… Now the Thing—”
“I do not want to hear about the Thing,” I interrupted—“nor about the crab with seven hands and eight
legs. I want to hear about the clothes.”
“What clothes?”
“At the time of their meeting, the two Ch'iens would have been differently dressed—very differently,
perhaps; for one was a maid, and the other a wife. Did the clothes of the two also blend together? Suppose
that one had a silk robe and the other a robe of cotton, would these have mixed into a texture of silk and
cotton? Suppose that one was wearing a blue girdle, and the other a yellow girdle, would the result have
been a green girdle?… Or did one Ch'ien simply slip out of her costume, and leave it on the ground, like the
cast-off shell of a cicada?”
“None of the texts says anything about the clothes,” my friend replied: “so I cannot tell you. But the
subject is quite irrelevant, from the Buddhist point of view. The doctrinal question is the question of what I
suppose you would call the personality of Ch'ien.”
“And yet it is not answered,” I said.
“It is best answered,” my friend replied, “by not being answered.”
“How so?”
“Because there is no such thing as personality.”2
Lafcadio Hearn was born on the Ionian island of Santa Maura of a Greek mother and an Irish
father, a surgeon major in the British army. He was raised by his Irish grandmother, filled we may
be sure with folk stories and fairy tales. He became an essayist and a storyteller who wandered the
world and finally settled in Japan, married a Japanese woman, and took Japanese citizenship under
the name Koizumi Yakumo. He was an important interpreter of Japan to the English-speaking
world, and today his stories are read in English by Japanese people who are interested in the
culture of their great-grandparents. Throughout his life he devoted himself to these folk stories and
wrote many of his own. Yet he did not always see into their mythic configurations. On this
occasion, rather than listen to his friend, who must have had some Zen eye, Hearn was off on his
question about the clothes. The question is ridiculous and really unlike Hearn, who was quite
capable of suspending belief. Off he went flashing his wit and intellect, as people sometimes do in
the interview room, flashing history or philosophy or psychology. I can't help feeling that he was
resisting the suggestion that he look deeper than the surface.
Wu-men comments: “If you realize the true one, then you'll know that emerging from one husk
and entering another is like a traveler putting up at an inn.” Once Yamada Rōshi asked a student of
the Diamond Sangha, “What do you think of death?” She replied, “Why, it's like when a bus stops
before you—you get on and go.” He approved that answer and Wu-men would too, I think. The
young woman Ch'ien separated and rejoined. Can you identify her? It is not enough to say they

were one from the beginning. Where is the real Ch'ien?
“If this is still not clear, don't rush about recklessly.” Wu-men is admonishing you not to flit
from teacher to teacher, from doctrine to doctrine, from practice to practice. More than that, Wu-
men is kindly advising you not to rush about with interpretations and analysis. Just settle patiently
into your practice.
“When you suddenly separate into earth, water, fire, and air, you'll be like a crab dropped into
boiling water, struggling with your seven hands and eight legs.” The image is all too vivid. A crab
is cooked by placing the live animal in boiling water. It doesn't die right away, but struggles
against the lid of the pot. What will be your reaction when that lid comes down over you? This
question is reminiscent of the question by Tou-shuai (Tosotsu): “When you have seen into your true
nature, you will be free of birth and death. How will you free yourself when your eyes are
darkening for the last time?”3 At such a time, says Wu-men, “Don't say I didn't warn you.”
Dying well, in the Victorian phrase, is more than going calmly. Surely, it is a great adventure. I
noticed an interview with Ram Dass in the newspaper recently in which he spoke of dying as “a
great creative act.”
It is living well, however, that is Wu-tsu's lesson. In his teishō on this case, one of my long-
time students points out that living a divided life is debilitating. It laid the woman Ch'ien out
completely. And there is more than one way of being divided. Seated at my desk, I long to be on
the line protesting the destruction of the habitat. Thus I cannot be effective in either place. The man
who takes a mistress slights both his family and his new love. His spirit divided, he dissipates his
potential as an integrated person.
Wu-men's verse begins: “The moon and the clouds are the same.” Ch'ien living with her
husband and children; Ch'ien pining at home—aren't these the same Ch'ien? All your actions,
cleaning the bathtub, crossing the street, paying bills, are movements in separate circumstances of
the same essential you. In the context of the story, how are moon and clouds the same?
“Mountains and valleys are different.” Ch'ien was wife and mother in the far city. Ch'ien was
a sick daughter at home. They were widely separated in every way. These are interpretations of the
story, of course. You must see the application of these two lines in your own life.
“All are blessed, all are blessed.” The blessed outcome! “Is this one? Is this two?” Now about
this thing—what do you say? Two Ch'iens? One Ch'ien? Can the true one be two?

Yün-men said, “You have misspoken.”
Later, the master Ssu-hsin took up this matter and asked, “Tell me, where did the monk

When Kuei-shan was with Pai-chang's assembly, he was cook of the monastery. Pai-chang
wanted to choose a founding teacher for Mount Ta-kuei. He invited all his monks to make a
presentation, saying, “The outstanding one will be sent.” Then he took a water bottle and set it
on the floor, and said, “Don't call this a water bottle. What would you call it?”
The head monk said, “It can't be called a wooden clog.”
Pai-chang then asked Kuei-shan his opinion. Kuei-shan kicked over the water bottle and
walked out.
Pai-chang laughed and said, “The head monk loses.” Kuei-shan thereupon was made the
founding teacher at Mount Ta-kuei.

Bodhidharma faced the wall. The Second Ancestor stood in the snow, cut off his arm, and said,
“Your disciple's mind has no peace as yet. I beg you, Master, please put it to rest.”
Bodhidharma said, “Bring me your mind, and I will put it to rest.”
The Second Ancestor said, “I have searched for my mind, but I cannot find it.”
Bodhidharma said, “I have completely put it to rest for you.”

Once Mañjuśrī went to a place where many Buddhas had assembled with the World-Honored
One. When he arrived, all the Buddhas had returned to their original dwelling place. Only a
young woman remained, seated in samādhi, near the Buddha's seat.
Mañjuśrī addressed the Buddha and asked, “How can the young woman get near the
Buddha's seat when I cannot?”
The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī, “Awaken this young woman from her samādhi and ask her
yourself!” Mañjuśrī walked around the young woman three times, snapped his fingers once,
took her to the Brahma Heaven and exerted all his supernatural powers, but he could not bring
her out.
The World-Honored One said, “Even a hundred thousand Mañjuśrīs cannot awaken her.
Down below, past twelve hundred million lands, as innumerable as sands of the Ganges, lives
the Bodhisattva of Delusive Wisdom. He will be able to bring her out of her samādhi.”
Instantly the Bodhisattva of Delusive Wisdom emerged from the earth and made bows before
the World-Honored One, who gave him his imperial order. Delusive Wisdom stepped before the
young woman, snapped his fingers once, and at this she came out of samādhi.

For past Buddhas surely a teacher;
for present Buddhas surely a resource;
this Mañjuśrī is not Mañjuśrī;
on the tips of a million hairs, a million lions.

The priest Tou-shuai set up three barriers in order to examine his students:
“You make your way through the darkness of abandoned grasses in a single-minded search
for your self-nature. Now, honored one, where is your nature?”
“When you have realized your self-nature, you are free of birth and death. When the light of
your eyes falls, how are you free?”
“When you are free of birth and death, you know where to go. When your four elements
scatter, where do you go?”

A monk asked the priest Kan-feng, “'Bhagavats in the Ten Directions, one straight road to
nirvana.' I wonder where that road is.”
Kan-feng lifted up his staff, drew a line in the air, and said, “Here it is.”
Later a monk asked Yün-men about this. Yün-men held up his fan and said, “This fan jumps
up to the Heaven of the Thirty-three and strikes the nose of the deity Śakradevendra. Give a
carp of the Eastern Sea one blow, and the rain comes down in torrents.”
